## 📖 About
<p>Create, using React, an application that should be able to calculate the appreciation/depreciation of a capital based on a monthly interest rate and time (months), using the compound interest concept.</p>

---

## 🛠 Technologies used
- CSS
- HTML
- Javascript
- React
- Hooks
- Materialize
- Node.js

---

## 📌Requirements
- Define the elements that will be considered as application state:
  - capital
  - monthly interest rate
  - period
- These elements will also be inputs of the application.
- Inputs shall be type number
  - Capital value goes from  0 to 100.000, step of 100
  - Interest rate value goes from -12 to 12, step of 0.1
  - Period value goes from 1 to 36, step of 1
- Output will be N boxes, being N the number of months, each one containing:
  - total value (amount after appreciation/depreciation of N months)
  - interest (value of appreciation/depreciation)
  - percentage (of appreciation/depreciation over the capital)
- The interest rate may be positive (appreciation) or negative (depreciation).
- Research and choose on of the compound interest formulas to implement.
- Improve interface using Materialize.
- Implementation shall use functional components and hooks.

## 🔍Development Tips
Use useEffect hook, with the three inputs as deps, to "watch" their change and recalculate the outputs.
